## Purpose of the project

I have developed this project during my 7th semester of computer science engineering for the completion of an academic mini-project.

## Conclusion

The interior design management system is an application that has 2 modules i.e. Administrator module and the User module. The administrator manages all information and has access rights to add, delete, edit and view the data related to projects, clients, customers/users, interiors, etc. Users can view all the interior designs and also can apply filters to choose the required interior design. Users can contact the admin through the contact form. In the future, theÂ project can be extended to maintain all the details of interior designs in the system. The future version will include storing the details of all the interiors which attract customers etc.
